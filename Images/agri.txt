 Like Mariyamma, other farmers in Idukki, too, are taking to this new trend of agritourism - which involves tourism activities centred around agriculture and its operation.

Situated just 53 kms from Munnar, Marayoor and Kanthalloor regions in Kerala’s Idukki district are fast emerging as major destinations for agritourism. Winter vegetable and fruit farms, sugarcane farms and jaggery production units are some of the main attractions, which have been drawing tourists to these regions.
Three years ago, the state government’s Kerala State Horticultural Products Development Corporation (Horticorp) had announced Idukki as a winter vegetable zone. This included the Kanthalloor and Vattavada regions and the Devikulam block.

Agriculture Minister VS Sunilkumar had inaugurated over Rs 11 crore worth winter vegetable and fruit production development project in Kanthalloor and Vattavada.

This came as a major boost for the farmers as until government intervention, they had to depend on middlemen.

Three years following the announcement of the project, over 2,725 hectares in Vattavada and Kanthalloor region have been cultivating seasonal vegetables and fruits, including potato, beans, guava and mango, among others. The year-long chilly weather is a huge factor in this kind of farming, and even in attracting tourists. As part of the project, the production of winter vegetables and fruits increased significantly in the Kanthalloor and Vattavada region.
