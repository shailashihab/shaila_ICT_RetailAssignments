List of some  Archaeological sites in Kerala :


<li>Anakkara megalithic necropolis
    <div>
        Anakkara megalithic necropolis is an Early Iron Age megalithic cemetery located at Anakkara, near Kuttippuram in Malappuram district, Kerala state, India on the Bharathappuzha basin. The structure is distinguished with cairn circles built around 500 BCE, postholes that probably point to the ancient practice of excarnation, and a woodhenge-like ritual monument and a site of primitive astronomical intelligence. It is he first time in India that postholes have been found in the context of a megalithic cemetery.

<li>Anchuthengu
    <div>Anchuthengu, formerly known as Anjengo, is a coastal town in the Thiruvananthapuram District of Kerala.
        This was an old Portuguese settlement lies between Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram, near Varkala. Literally the word ‘Anjuthengu’ means 'five coconut palms.’ The whole land is cultivated with coconut palms.
        Anjengo Beach
        The place possesses great archaeological and historical importance. In 17th century, the English East India Company selected Anjengo to set up their first trade settlement in Kerala. The Queen of Attingal granted the place to the British for trading. They established a factory and a fort here with the permission of the queen.
        Many ancient churches, an old Lighthouse, a 100 year old convent and school, tombs of Dutch and British and the Anjengo Fort are major points of interest here. The churches are built in accordance with the principles of the Portuguese architectural style. The fort played an important role in the Anglo-Mysore Wars in the 18th century.
        Anchuthengu has a beautiful and clean beach. Fishing boats parked on the hot sand and nets drying in the sun are worth seeing. Kaikara village, the birth place of the famous Malayalam poet Kumaran Asan, is located nearby.

        </div>
</li>
<li>Bekal Fort
    <div>'Bekal Fort' is the largest fort in Kasargod, Kerala, India, spreading over 40 acres (160,000 m2). Some important features of this fort are the water-tank with its flight of steps, the tunnel opening towards the south, the magazine for keeping ammunition and the broad steps leading to the Observation Tower, which is a rarity. From there one has an ample view of towns in the vicinity like Kanhangad, Pallikare, Bekal, Kottikkulam, Uduma etc. The nearest railway stations are Pallikare, Kotikulam, Kanhangad,and Kasargod. This observation center had strategic significance in discovering even the smallest movements of the enemy and ensuring the safety of the Fort.
        The Fort appears to have been built up from the sea since almost three fourths of its exterior is drenched and the waves continually stroke the citadel. The Mukhyaprana Temple of Hanuman and the ancient Muslim mosque nearby bear testimony to the age-old religious harmony that prevailed in the area. The zigzag entrance and the trenches around the fort show the defense strategy inherent in the fort.
        Unlike most other Indian forts, Bekal Fort was not a center of administration, for no remains of any palace, mansion or such buildings are found within the fort. Arguably the fort was built exclusively for fulfilling defense requirements. The holes on the outer walls of the fort are specially designed to defend the fort effectively. The holes at top were meant for aiming at the farthest points; the holes below for striking when the enemy was nearer and the holes underneath facilitated attacking when the enemy was very near to the fort. This is remarkable evidence of technology in defense strategy.

<li>Cherpu
    <div>Cherpu is a small village in Thrissur district of Kerala state in south India. It is 12 kilometres south of Thrissur town and is on the Thriprayar road. It is dotted by a number of temples and has quite a few rivers flowing by its vicinity.
        The village occupies a prominent place in the Kerala's cultural map as Cherpu is one of the main venues of the state's classical percussion ensembles like chenda melam and panchavadyam, staged as they are during temple festivals called pooram. Naturally, Cherpu is the birthplace of many leading (as well as lesser known) practitioners of ethnic Kerala instruments like chenda, ilathalam, kombu, kuzhal, timila, maddalam and edakka.
        Cherpu has two major poorams—Peruvanam Pooram and Arattupuzha Pooram. Peruvanam, otherwise traditionally known as one of the leading Namboodiri villages of Kerala, has today many of its people employed in the manufacture of furniture and gold ornaments. Legend has it that Peruvanam village was one of the settlements created by sage Parashuram, the mythical creator of Kerala.
        The name Cherpu means cherunnidam (joining place) in Malayalam. Cherpu was a central place for Mahatma Gandhi's village renaissance. It was known as "Vardha" at the time of the Kochi kingdom.
        As for its temples, Cherpu has the grand-structured Peruvanam temple besides the ones called Arattupuzha, Urakam and Thiruvullakkavu. Thiruvullakkavu temple is famous for initiating children to the world of letters on Vidyarambham, an auspicious day in Hindu tradition.
        For long, Cherpu had paddy fields that spread as far as Triprayar. The west and east sides of Cherpu were marked by rocks. Cherpu is located in between this rock- and water-covered area. Hence the name Cherpu or cherunnidam (joining place).

    <div>Kandanissery is a small village in the Indian state of Kerala.
        'Guruvayur' a well known Hindu pilgrimage centre is very near to Kandanissery.
        There is no idea about the origin of name 'Kandanissery'.
        Human settlement began in this area around bc 1000. The very fertile soil and plenty of water attracted human settlement. Paddy and Coconut were main crops. We can see the remains of Jaina and Brahmin settlement here. Small caves known as 'munimada' still intact, kudakkallu an old burial site is in the border of kandnaissery. Some old temples are clear evidence of Brahmin settlement. In distant past small group of Brahmins dominate over Ezhavas by political power and money. By some unknown reason's a type of revolution began in ezhava community and it leads to the crush of the Brahmin settlement. This is a real setback to Brahmins, they are refugee's in their own land.They pass some of their properties and Goddess to a Nair family. Thus the ownership of 40%land goes to the hand of Nair family. At that time some ezhava families possess huge area of land.It is a very rare case not seen in any part of Kerala. Some other families possess land by giving rent to the chiralayam raja family and choondakathu othalur mana. After the retreat of Brahmin's some ezhava families became exploiters of poor peasant's. It end after the Indian independence, by the bill of 'land reform' by the communist government in Kerala headed by E.M. Sankaran Nambudirippad.

<li>Muziris
    <div>
        Muziris (Muchiri or Mucciri,  was an ancient seaport and urban center in southwestern India on the Periyar that existed from around the beginning of the Christian era to the 1300s. Muziris has found mention in the classical Tamil Sangha literature and a number of European historical sources. In a massive flood of the Periyar in 1341 CE, Muziris was said to have been destroyed and the centre of commerce was shifted to other ports on the Malabar Coast. Soon the exact location of Muziris was forgotten; currently, it is believed to have been located close to the present day Kodungallur.
        The multi-disciplinary and multi-seasonal archaeological research in the area was conducted by the Kerala Council for Historical Research (KCHR) at Pattanam, a small village at North Parur. It is hypothesized that Pattanam could be an integral part of Muziris. Pattanam was the first site in the Indian Ocean to yield archaeological evidence for Mediterranean, North African, West Asian and Chinese maritime contacts. The evidence suggested that Pattanam was a commercial location exposed to long distance and regional trade, prior to Roman contact.
