    <p>Sandwiched between the lofty green-shrouded Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea lies Kerala, the quiet mystic â€“ Gods Own Country. Kerala is well endowed with avifauna as nearly 500 species of resident and migratory birds abound in this area. Lush green tropical forests, numerous freshwater and brackish lakes and waterlogged paddy fields form the major birding habitats of this region. Since the time when Prof:K.K.Neelakantan first mesmerised a wide audience with his entertaining books in Malayalam; birdwatching has caught the public imagination. Kerala is both literally and metaphorically lush! Out of the sticky heat it feels as if the plants are growing as you watch and you will not be disappointed with the birds.The new Kerala mailing list is the result of growing interest in birding and provides a digital habitat for birders of Kerala.</p>

    <li>Periyar Tiger Reserve
    
        Parambikulam - Periyar is well located as a centre for seeing most of these ornithological specialties of the Western Ghats, as well as large numbers of other resident hill species and migrants. It is also one of the best-managed Tiger Reserves in the country and is home to large herds of elephants, bison, bears, leopards and tigers. Its attraction for birdwatchers is enhanced by the proximity of low-lying plains on three sides. There is considerable local migration of lowland species, often in the drier weather, up into the foothills, and several interesting examples of ecological counterparts in pairs of wet zone and dry zone species can be found, e.g. the Barbets. This is particularly noticeable at Thekkady, conveniently sited near the top of a steep 450m/1500ft ghat above the dry Tamil Nadu plain. In deciduous forest around Thekkady the commonest species in mixed foraging flocks are, in descending order Racket-tailed Drongo, Scarlet Minivet, Velvet-fronted Nuthatch, Bronzed Drongo, Grey Tit, Golden-backed Woodpeckers, White-bellied Treepie, Jungle Babbler, Indian Rufus Treepie, Yellow-browed Bulbul, Large Wood Shrike, Ashy Drongo, Small Minivet, Gold-fronted Leafbird, Small Green Barbet and a variety of Flowerpeckers. Other common birds include Orioles, Fairy Bluebird, Leaf Warbler, Flycatchers and Quaker Babbler. Almost all species recorded in the sanctuary can be seen at one time or another in the Tourist Zone, although it is necessary to climb to the grassy hilltops find some, such as Brown Pipit and Pied Bush Chat.
