    <h1>CULINARY TOURISM IN KERALA</h1>
   
   <br>
   
       <p> Kerala offers several gastronomic opportunities. Spices that flavor the local cuisine give it a sharp pungency that is heightened with the use of  Tamarind and Kodapuli, while Coconut gives it its richness absorbing some of the tongue-teasing, pepper- hot flavors. However, there is a good deal of seafood available, and the prawn curries in their beds of coconut gravy are exceptionally good. Curries are eaten usually with plain steamed rice. Other delicacies include APPAM a puffy variation of DOSA [fermented coconut- water or Toddy is mixed for making APPAMS] and can be had either with kadala curry (black chickpeas curry), egg masala or chicken curry. The traditional feast of Kerala- called  SADYA â€“ is dished up readily during Onam, in every eatery, restaurant or home. Exotically served on a clean fresh banana leaf, this multi-course extravaganza comprises mainly rice and countless curries and dishes, all delectably vegetarian, most of them coconut-based. With various tongue-tingling pickles adding that touch of spice. And topped by large helpings of Payasams- a sweet milky porridge served with dried fruits and nuts.</p>
    </p><p>Spices have always played an integral part of Kerala's history. Our food is an example of the very same and we have offerings for people from all over the world.  Be it famous international restaurant chains or local eateries, we have everything a foodie could ask for prepared with that special Kerala taste to it. The cuisine here caters to vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. Let the flavours of our past and our future take you on a delightful journey.</p>
