    <h1>Dental tourism in Kerala</h1>
    <p>Dental tourism, a sub sector of medical tourism, is a fast developing industry in India. Over the last 5 years, there has been a phenomenal increase in the number of foreigners seeking dental care in India. With the hefty amounts required to treat a dental ailment in a Western country, one can actually conduct a pleasure trip down to India, visit the great tourist destinations here, and get their ailments cured in between – that too spending only half as much as what they might back in Europe!
<br>
        Dental treatment in India is inexpensive compared to the treatment costs in your home country. Nor does it lack the much needed skill, technology or modernity! Dental hygiene in India has improved by leaps and bounds to match European standards and so did the quality of dental equipment! Suffice it to say that the whole world now considers India as a potential dental tourism market! There is no reason why India can’t top the list of dental tourism destinations! If the recent influx of dental tourists is any indication, we are going to be at the top in no time!

        With the world becoming a global village, it is no longer the prerogative of the rich and famous to travel abroad for better medical facilities. Middles class families worldwide are now looking beyond boundaries in search of cost effective medical treatments in specialized areas.
        <br>
        Along with the fact that India has taken huge strides in the field of medicine, providing high quality medical care at a fraction of its cost in the west has further accentuated the growth of a new age field “Medical Tourism.”A study by McKinsey and CII estimated that India’s medical tourism will have annual revenue to the tune of $2.3 billion and a sizeable portion of this would be propelled by a 30% annual growth rate in the field of dental tourism.
