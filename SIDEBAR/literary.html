   <p> 'Literature', as the dictionary meaning says, is "The writings of a period, language, or country, especially those kept alive by their beauty of style or thought". In simple terms, it is anything constructed from a meaningful arrangement of words
</p>
 <p>   The story of Malayalam literature can be associated simultaneously with the origin of Malayalam itself. The first recorded evidence of its literature is dated back to 13th century. Malayalam is often referred to as a poetic language. The language is affluent in every genre of literature. Although each successive generation has added its own contribution to Malayalam literature, the ancient texts are still influential. Due to the lack of printed medium, the literature of ancient period reached their audience through performances like dramas, art forms like Kathakali, Ottenthullal, Koodiattam etc. and through recitation like indigenous ballads and folk songs. It also found its way to the younger generations in the form of bedtime stories. Apart from indigenous literary works, translations from other languages have further enriched the Malayalam literature	 
</p> 

<p><h3>Thunchath Ezhuthachchan</h3>  is considered as the 'Father of Malayalam Literature'. His works like the Adhyathmaramayanam, Bhagavatham, Ramayanam etc...

    remain as the classics of Malayalam literature. The style of poetry which he popularised is known as 'Kilippattu'. Ezhuthachan along with Kunjan Nambiyar and Cherussery were the most influential poets of the past. Three of them collectively is known as 'The Great Trio (mahakavitrayam)' of the past (earlier period). Their contribution to the development of the language is incomparable and will be long cherished. Many of the literary works of the time still remain unrivaled and will remain so	 
   </p> <p>Because many of the rulers of the period were patrons of art and literature, literary and artistic works were always appreciated and rewarded. A number of poets adorned the courts of these rulers. Irayimman Thampi's 'Omana thinkal kidavo.... ' is one of the best lullabies ever created. N. Kumaranaasan, Vallathol Narayana Menon and S. Parameswara Iyer are together known as 'The Great Trio' of the modern (later) period. They revitalise and further enriched Malayalam literature with their contributions. G Shankarakkurup is the first recepient of the Gyanpith Award, one of the highest recognitions for literary work in India. He was followed by Thakazhi, S. K. Pottekkad and M.T. Vasudevan Nair to win this honor	 
    
    With the advent of the Europeans, Malayalam literature saw colossal changes, both in its style and language. It was greatly influenced by western literature. By the mid 19th century christian missionaries like Benjamin Bailey and Herman Gundert published dictionaries and grammer books. Gundert setup the first printing press in Kerala at Kottayam. The improvement in printed media helped the literary works reach the comman man and hence popularising it

<p><h3>Madhavikutty (b. 1932)</h3>

    
    is the pen-name adopted by Kamala Das in her Malayalam writings. Though internationally renowned for her spirited poems in English, Kamala Das nee Madhavikutty has penned some brilliant short stories in her mother tongue. Her pseudonym represents the more intense and confessional self of this feminist writer. Her stories first appeared on the Malayalam literary scene in the 1950s, and later more frequently, in the sixties. She unleashed in them the pent-up world of female urges, frustrations and wild sexual fantasies, thus exposing the raw side of human identity. Madhavikutty's focus has always been on the tormented female self craving for love, but doomed to be cheated, exploited and abandoned. She replaced the self-pity that was a staple element of conventional women's stories with a subversive, vengeful imagination that demythified love, sex and even death. Her principal works include Naricheerukal Parakkumbol (When Bats Fly, 1960), Thanuppu (Cold, 1967), Madhavikuttiyude Kathakal (The Short Stories of Madhavikutty, 1982), and Neypayasam (Rice Pudding, 1991) and Ente Katha (My Story).
